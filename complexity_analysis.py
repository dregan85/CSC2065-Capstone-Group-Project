# Big O notations used for each operation:
# Add Node O(1) - takes constant time because it only adds a single entry
# Remove Node O(1) - takes constant time because it only removes a single entry
# Add Edge O(1) - takes constant time because it only adds a single entry
# Remove Edge O(1) - takes constant time because it only removes a single entry
# Check Neighbors O(d) - takes time depending on how many neighbors each node has (degree)
# Breadth First Search O(V + E) - time taken is proportional to to the total number of nodes + edges
# Depth First Search O(V + E) - time taken is proportional to to the total number of nodes + edges
# Adjacency Matrix O(V^2) - time taken is proportional to the square number of nodes
